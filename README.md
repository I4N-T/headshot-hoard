The idea of the game is simple - kill everything you see, collect powerups, and try to rack up as many points as possible.

Use WASD to move, SPACE to jump, and LEFT CLICK to shoot.

The theme of the game is "Surprise", and that is realized in several ways:

* The location in which any given zombie spawns will be a surprise.
* All powerup drops look the same, but it is a surprise which bonus they will give you.
* Some monsters are able to teleport to surprise locations.
* If you happen to get a health bonus as a powerup, the amount of health rewarded will be a surprise.
* The game is surprisingly fun to play.
